## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm a third-year Computer Science student with a passion for building thingsâ€”especially for the web.

Since summer 2024, Iâ€™ve been working part-time as a Full-Stack Web Developer, where Iâ€™ve gained hands-on experience building real-world applications. I enjoy turning ideas into functional, user-friendly software and constantly learning new technologies in the process.

### ðŸ’» Tech I work with most:
